## 🚀 AutoML - Automating Machine Learning
# 🎯 What is AutoML?
AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It includes:
 ✅ Handling missing values and data preprocessing 🧹
 ✅ Feature selection and engineering 🔍
 ✅ Choosing the best machine learning model 🏆
 ✅ Hyperparameter tuning and optimization ⚙️
 ✅ Model evaluation and performance analysis 📊

# 💡 Why Use AutoML?
 🔹 Saves Time: Instead of manually testing multiple models, AutoML automates the process.
 🔹 Easy to Use: It allows non-experts to build powerful models with minimal effort.
 🔹 Optimized Performance: It selects the best-performing model by testing different algorithms and configurations.

# 🚀 Popular AutoML Libraries
 📌 H2O AutoML - Automatically trains multiple models and selects the best one
 📌 TPOT - Uses Genetic Algorithms to optimize models
 📌 Auto-sklearn - A powerful AutoML library based on scikit-learn
 📌 PyCaret - A low-code machine learning library for quick model training
 📌 LazyPredict - Quickly compares multiple models with minimal effort 


# 🎯 Conclusion
AutoML simplifies the machine learning workflow by automating model selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. It enables developers and data scientists to build high-performing models with less manual effort! 🤖✨
